Java Programming
====================

Hello, Here I will be uploading as much Java source code as possible. 

Simple Programs
---------------------

Here I will be uploading simple programs that only really require simple knowledge of java.
The programs will mostly be in one java file, it will be only used if you want to reference to a certain method or how you can do something simple.
For Example: If you forget how to get the square route of something, there will be a simple java program to tell you how. That's my Goal.
